# MCU Template for CH551, CH552, and CH554 Microcontrollers
The CH55x is an 8-bit enhanced E8051 core MCU compatible with the MCS51 instruction set. 79% of its instructions are single-byte single-cycle instructions, and the average instruction speed is 8 - 15 times faster than that of the standard MCS51. The special xRAM supports direct memory access (DMA), data fast copy command, and double DPTR pointers. The CH55x has a built-in USB controller and USB transceiver, it supports USB-Host mode (CH554 only) and USB-Device mode (all), USB Type-C master-slave detection, USB 2.0 full-speed (12Mbps) and low-speed (1.5Mbps) traffic, data packets of up to 64 bytes, and DMA. It has a factory built-in bootloader so firmware can be uploaded directly via USB without the need for an additional programming device.

The 'template' directory includes a makefile, an illustrative program, a linker script, fundamental libraries, and a programming tool. These elements are intended to serve as a foundation for beginning the development of bare-metal firmware in the C programming language for this particular microcontroller.

Furthermore, inside the 'libraries' directory, there are optional libraries available for certain peripherals. If you intend to utilize these libraries, you need to copy them into the 'include' folder within the 'template' directory.

# Using the Makefile
To make use of the *makefile*, it's necessary to install some extra software components to fully set up the toolchain:

## Install SDCC toolchain for compiling
```
sudo apt install build-essential sdcc
```

## Install Python3 and PyUSB for the programming tool
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
python3 -m pip install pyusb
```

## Give access permission to the factory built-in bootloader
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="4348", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

## Compiling/Uploading
Edit the *makefile* according to the needs of the project. Use one of the following commands inside the *template* folder to compile/upload:

```
make all       compile, build and keep all files
make hex       compile and build <firmware>.hex
make bin       compile and build <firmware>.bin
make flash     compile, build and upload to MCU
make clean     remove all build files
```
