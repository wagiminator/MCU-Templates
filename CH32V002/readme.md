# MCU Template for CH32V002, V004, V005, V006, V007, M007 Microcontrollers
The CH32V00X series are industrial-grade, general-purpose microcontrollers built on a 32-bit RISC-V instruction set and architecture. They use the QingKe V2C core with the RV32EC instruction set and support up to two levels of interrupt nesting. These microcontrollers include a variety of peripheral interfaces and functional modules. Their design is optimized for cost-effective and low-power embedded applications.

The *template* directory includes a makefile, a PlatformIO.ini file, an illustrative program, a linker script, and fundamental libraries. These elements are intended to serve as a foundation for beginning the development of bare-metal firmware in the C programming language for this particular microcontroller.

Furthermore, inside the *libraries* directory, there are optional libraries available for certain peripherals. If you intend to utilize these libraries, you need to copy them into the *src* folder within the *template* directory.

# Compiling Firmware
## Using the Makefile
To make use of the *makefile*, it's necessary to install some extra software components to fully set up the toolchain:

### Install GCC Toolchain for Compiling
```
sudo apt install build-essential libnewlib-dev gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
```

### Install Python3 and Programming Tool
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install rvprog
```

### Give Access Permission to the WCH-LinkE Programmer
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8010", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8012", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

### Compiling/Uploading
Edit the *makefile* according to the needs of the project. Use one of the following commands inside the *template* folder to compile/upload:

```
make all       compile and build <firmware>.elf/.bin/.hex/.asm
make hex       compile and build <firmware>.hex
make asm       compile and disassemble to <firmware>.asm
make bin       compile and build <firmware>.bin
make flash     compile and upload to MCU
make clean     remove all build files
```

## Using PlatformIO
- Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) and [platform-ch32v](https://github.com/Community-PIO-CH32V/platform-ch32v). Follow [these instructions](https://pio-ch32v.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to do so. Linux/Mac users may also need to install [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv).
- Click on "Open Project" and select the *template* folder with the *platformio.ini* file.
- Edit the *platformio.ini* according to the needs of the project and your programmmer.
- Connect the WCH-LinkE to the target board, then click "Upload".

# Uploading Firmware
## WCH-LinkE Programming and Debugging Device
To program the microcontroller via the serial debug interface, you will need a special programming device. The [WCH-LinkE](http://www.wch-ic.com/products/WCH-Link.html) (pay attention to the "E" in the name) is a suitable option for this purpose and can be purchased commercially. This debugging tool is compatible with most WCH RISC-V and ARM-based microcontrollers.

To use the WCH-LinkE on Linux, you need to grant access permissions beforehand by executing the following commands:
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8010", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8012", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

On Windows, if you need to you can install the WinUSB driver over the WCH interface 1 using the [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) tool.

To upload firmware, you should make the following connections to the WCH-LinkE:

```
WCH-LinkE      MCU Board
+-------+      +-------+
|  SWDIO| <--> |SWDIO  |
|    GND| ---> |GND    |
|    3V3| ---> |VDD    |
+-------+      +-------+
```

If the blue LED on the WCH-LinkE remains illuminated once it is connected to the USB port, it means that the device is currently in ARM mode and must be switched to RISC-V mode initially. There are a few ways to accomplish this:
- You can utilize the Python command-line tool [rvprog](https://pypi.org/project/rvprog/) (with *-v* option).
- Alternatively, you can select "WCH-LinkRV" in the software provided by WCH, such as MounRiver Studio or WCH-LinkUtility.
- Another option is to hold down the ModeS button on the device while plugging it into the USB port.

More information can be found in the [WCH-Link User Manual](http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/WCH-LinkUserManual_PDF.html).

## Uploading Firmware Binary
WCH offers the free but closed-source software [WCH-LinkUtility](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/WCH-LinkUtility_ZIP.html) to upload the precompiled hex-file with Windows. Select the "WCH-LinkRV" mode in the software, open the *<firmware>.hex* file and upload it to the microcontroller.

Alternatively, there is an open-source tool called [minichlink](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun/tree/master/minichlink) developed by Charles Lohr (CNLohr). It can be used with Windows, Linux and Mac.

If you have installed [Python3](https://www.pythontutorial.net/getting-started/install-python/) on your system, you can also use the platform-independent open-source command-line tool [rvprog](https://pypi.org/project/rvprog/) for uploading:
```
rvprog -f <firmware>.bin
```
