# MCU Template for the STC8H8K64U Series Microcontrollers
The STC8H8K64U is a cost-effective 8-bit ultra-high speed 8051 core USB2.0 Microcontroller compatible with the MCS51 instruction set. The average instruction speed is about 12 times faster than that of the traditional 8051. It allows a clock frequency of up to 40Mhz, operates in the voltage range from 1.9V to 5.5V, and incorporates all standard peripherals such as 12-bit ADC, analog comparator, multiple timers, PWM, DMA, UART, SPI, and I2C. It has a factory built-in USB bootloader so firmware can be uploaded directly via USB without the need for an additional programming device.

The 'template' directory includes a makefile, an illustrative program, a linker script, fundamental libraries, and a programming tool. These elements are intended to serve as a foundation for beginning the development of bare-metal firmware in the C programming language for this particular microcontroller.

Furthermore, inside the 'libraries' directory, there are optional libraries available for certain peripherals. If you intend to utilize these libraries, you need to copy them into the 'include' folder within the 'template' directory.

# Using the Makefile
To make use of the *makefile*, it's necessary to install some extra software components to fully set up the toolchain:

## Install SDCC Ttoolchain for Compiling
```
sudo apt install build-essential sdcc
```

## Install Python3 and Programming Tool
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install stc8usb
```

## Give Access Permission to the Factory built-in Bootloader
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="34bf", ATTR{idProduct}=="1001", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-STC-ISP.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

## Compiling/Uploading
Edit the *makefile* according to the needs of the project. Use one of the following commands inside the *template* folder to compile/upload:

```
make all       compile, build and keep all files
make hex       compile and build <firmware>.hex
make bin       compile and build <firmware>.bin
make flash     compile, build and upload to MCU
make clean     remove all build files
```

# Factory built-in USB Bootlader
The MCU has an embedded bootloader with USB interface, which can be used to upload firmware. The open-source platform-independent Python tool [stc8usb](https://pypi.org/project/stc8usb/) can be used for this purpose.

To initiate new uploads, the bootloader needs to be manually started. Begin by unplugging the board from the USB port and disconnecting all power sources. Then, short pin P3.2 to ground while reconnecting the board to your PC's USB port. This action triggers the chip to enter bootloader mode. Once in this mode, you can release the pin P3.2 and proceed to upload new firmware via USB by running the following command (example):

```
stc8usb -t 24000000 -f firmware.bin
```
