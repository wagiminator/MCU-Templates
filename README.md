# MCU Templates
Discover a set of templates designed to simplify the initial stages of bare-metal firmware development for various microcontrollers. These templates eliminate the need for complicated Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs) and heavy closed-source development tools. They come with pre-configured Makefiles, linker scripts, programming tools, and libraries to streamline the development process.
