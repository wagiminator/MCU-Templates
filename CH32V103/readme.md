# MCU Template for CH32V103 Microcontrollers
The CH32V103 is a general purpose microcontroller based on the 32-bit RISC processor RISC-V3A. The CH32V103 provides clock security system, multi-level power management, and general DMA controller. The CH32V103 is also equipped with abundant peripheral resources, such as single USB2.0 host/device interface, multi-channel 12-bit ADC module, multi-channel TouchKey, several timers, and multi-channel IIC/USART/SPI interfaces, etc.

The *template* directory includes a makefile, a PlatformIO.ini file, an illustrative program, a linker script, and fundamental libraries. These elements are intended to serve as a foundation for beginning the development of bare-metal firmware in the C programming language for this particular microcontroller.

Furthermore, inside the *libraries* directory, there are optional libraries available for certain peripherals. If you intend to utilize these libraries, you need to copy them into the *src* folder within the *template* directory.

# Compiling Firmware
## Using the Makefile
To make use of the *makefile*, it's necessary to install some extra software components to fully set up the toolchain:

### Install GCC Toolchain for Compiling
```
sudo apt install build-essential libnewlib-dev gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
```

### Install Python3 and Programming Tools
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install chprog rvprog
```

### Give Access Permission to the Factory built-in Bootloader
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="4348", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

### Give Access Permission to the WCH-LinkE Programmer
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8010", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8012", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

### Compiling/Uploading
Edit the *makefile* according to the needs of the project. Use one of the following commands inside the *template* folder to compile/upload:

```
make all       compile and build <firmware>.elf/.bin/.hex/.asm
make hex       compile and build <firmware>.hex
make asm       compile and disassemble to <firmware>.asm
make bin       compile and build <firmware>.bin
make flash     compile and upload to MCU
make clean     remove all build files
```

## Using PlatformIO
- Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) and [platform-ch32v](https://github.com/Community-PIO-CH32V/platform-ch32v). Follow [these instructions](https://pio-ch32v.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to do so. Linux/Mac users may also need to install [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv).
- Click on "Open Project" and select the *template* folder with the *platformio.ini* file.
- Edit the *platformio.ini* according to the needs of the project and your programmmer.
- Connect the WCH-LinkE to the target board, then click "Upload".

# Uploading Firmware
## Via Factory built-in USB Bootlader
### Installing Drivers for the Bootloader
On Linux you do not need to install a driver. However, by default Linux will not expose enough permission to upload your code with the USB bootloader. In order to fix this, open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="4348", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

For Windows, you need the [CH372 driver](http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH372DRV_EXE.html). Alternatively, you can also use the [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) tool to install the correct driver. Here, click "Options" -> "List All Devices" and select the USB module. Then install the libusb-win32 driver. To do this, the board must be connected and the microcontroller must be in bootloader mode.

### Entering Bootloader Mode
The bootloader must be started manually for new uploads. To do this, the board must first be disconnected from the USB port and all voltage sources. Now press the BOOT (or DOWNLOAD) button and keep it pressed while reconnecting the board to the USB port of your PC. The chip now starts in bootloader mode, the BOOT button can be released and new firmware can be uploaded via USB within the next couple of seconds. If there is no BOOT button on the board, look at the datasheet to find out which pin needs to be pulled to which voltage level for the microcontroller to go into boot mode.

### Uploading Firmware Binary
WCH offers the free but closed-source software [WCHISPTool](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/WCHISPTool_Setup_exe.html) to upload firmware with Windows via the USB bootloader. Press the BOOT button and keep it pressed while connecting the board to the USB port of your PC. Release the BOOT button, open the *<firmware>.hex* file with WCHISPTool and upload it to the microcontroller.

If [Python3](https://www.pythontutorial.net/getting-started/install-python/) is installed, you can also use the platform-independent open-source command-line tool [chprog](https://pypi.org/project/chprog/) for uploading:
```
chprog <firmware>.bin
```

## Via 2-Wire Serial Debug Interface
### WCH-LinkE Programming and Debugging Device
To program the microcontroller via the serial debug interface, you will need a special programming device. The [WCH-LinkE](http://www.wch-ic.com/products/WCH-Link.html) (pay attention to the "E" in the name) is a suitable option for this purpose and can be purchased commercially. This debugging tool is compatible with most WCH RISC-V and ARM-based microcontrollers.

To use the WCH-LinkE on Linux, you need to grant access permissions beforehand by executing the following commands:
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8010", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8012", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

On Windows, if you need to you can install the WinUSB driver over the WCH interface 1 using the [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) tool.

To upload firmware, you should make the following connections to the WCH-LinkE:

```
WCH-LinkE      MCU Board
+-------+      +-------+
|  SWCLK| ---> |SWCLK  |
|  SWDIO| <--> |SWDIO  |
|    GND| ---> |GND    |
|    3V3| ---> |VDD    |
+-------+      +-------+
```

If the blue LED on the WCH-LinkE remains illuminated once it is connected to the USB port, it means that the device is currently in ARM mode and must be switched to RISC-V mode initially. There are a few ways to accomplish this:
- You can utilize the Python command-line tool [rvprog](https://pypi.org/project/rvprog/) (with *-v* option).
- Alternatively, you can select "WCH-LinkRV" in the software provided by WCH, such as MounRiver Studio or WCH-LinkUtility.
- Another option is to hold down the ModeS button on the device while plugging it into the USB port.

More information can be found in the [WCH-Link User Manual](http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/WCH-LinkUserManual_PDF.html).

### Uploading Firmware Binary
WCH offers the free but closed-source software [WCH-LinkUtility](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/WCH-LinkUtility_ZIP.html) to upload the precompiled hex-file with Windows. Select the "WCH-LinkRV" mode in the software, open the *<firmware>.hex* file and upload it to the microcontroller.

Alternatively, there is an open-source tool called [minichlink](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun/tree/master/minichlink) developed by Charles Lohr (CNLohr). It can be used with Windows, Linux and Mac.

If you have installed [Python3](https://www.pythontutorial.net/getting-started/install-python/) on your system, you can also use the platform-independent open-source command-line tool [rvprog](https://pypi.org/project/rvprog/) for uploading:
```
rvprog -f <firmware>.bin
```
